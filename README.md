# Enterovirus Assay Validatiion

This project assesses the performance of 4 pan-enterovirus qPCR quantification/diagnositic assays. I performed _in silico_ PCR for each assay with curated database of enterovirus sequences from NCBI Virus and a virus RefSeq database to obtain data on the predicted hits. Outputs for each assay against each database can be found in the Data folder. 

## Analysis Components  

- **EV_Assay_Comparison**: Venn diagrams illustrating the overlap of predicted hits by each assay to the curated enterovirus database, also broken down by enterovirus family group.  
- **EV_Assay_Mismatches**: Analysis of the occurrence of mismatches in sequences from the enterovirus database to each assay.  
- **EV_False_Negatives**: Comparison of the predicted hit sequences to total sequences over time and across enterovirus family groups.  
- **EV_False_Positives**: Search for predicted hits outside of the enterovirus family.
